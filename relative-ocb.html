  <h1>When Good Deeds Backfire: How Followers’ Relative OCB Can Trigger Unethical Favoritism</h1>

  <section>
    <p>In organizations, employees often go the extra mile to support their supervisors—helping with tasks, providing advice, or showing loyalty. These actions, called <strong>organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB)</strong>, are usually seen as positive. But what if good deeds could sometimes backfire?</p>

    <p>Our recent research explored this question by studying a new concept: <strong>relative OCB toward the supervisor (ROCBS)</strong>. Unlike traditional OCB, ROCBS measures how a particular employee’s supportive actions compare to other team members. In other words, it looks at a follower’s standing within the team in terms of how much they help or support their supervisor.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Relative OCB shapes perceived support:</strong> Supervisors noticed when certain employees consistently went above and beyond compared to others. This elevated perception of support became a powerful signal for supervisors.</li>
      <li><strong>Supervisor insecurity can trigger unethical favoritism:</strong> When supervisors were uncertain about their own competence, high perceived support often led them to show <strong>unethical favoritism behavior (UFB)</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>No favoritism when confidence is high:</strong> If supervisors were confident in their abilities, ROCBS and perceived support did not lead to UFB.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Lessons for Organizations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Monitor team dynamics: recognize and reward contributions fairly without creating dependency on certain employees.</li>
      <li>Strengthen leader confidence: training, coaching, and clear performance standards can reduce the likelihood that supervisors act unethically.</li>
      <li>Clarify ethical boundaries: employees’ helpful behaviors are valuable, but organizations must ensure that support does not become a reason for preferential treatment.</li>
      <li>Balance recognition: promote a culture where contributions are appreciated collectively, not just individually.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>Even positive behaviors like citizenship support can have unintended consequences. By measuring <strong>relative OCB</strong>, organizations can better understand team dynamics and design interventions that maximize benefits while minimizing ethical risks.</p>
