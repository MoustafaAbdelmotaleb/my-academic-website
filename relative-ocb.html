    <h1>Exploring Relative OCB</h1>
    <p>A new perspective on organizational citizenship behavior</p>
  </section>

    <p>
      The study introduces the concept of <strong>Relative Organizational Citizenship Behavior (Relative OCB)</strong>, 
      a novel way to understand workplace dynamics. Relative OCB refers to how a focal employee‚Äôs supportive behaviors 
      toward their supervisor compare to those of their peers. Instead of viewing OCB in isolation, this approach 
      emphasizes the <em>relative standing</em> of employees in demonstrating extra-role contributions.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      ‚ÄúRelative OCB captures not only what employees do, but how their actions stack up against others in the same context.‚Äù
    </div>

    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
    <p>
      Results from the study reveal that employees who engage in relatively higher OCB enjoy more positive evaluations 
      from supervisors. These employees are often perceived as more committed and loyal, which can translate into 
      career advantages. However, the relational nature of this concept means that some employees may look less 
      supportive simply because their peers are more active in helping behaviors.
    </p>

    <h2>Practical Implications</h2>
    <div class="callout">
      üìå For managers: Be mindful of comparing employees strictly on relative behaviors, as this may 
      unintentionally create competition instead of collaboration.  
      üìå For organizations: Policies that encourage teamwork rather than rivalry can ensure that 
      OCB remains a prosocial, not competitive, force.
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      By shifting the focus from absolute to relative measures of citizenship behaviors, the concept of Relative OCB 
      provides a richer lens for understanding how employees are evaluated in organizational settings. It highlights 
      both the promise and potential pitfalls of recognizing contributions in a comparative framework.
