  <h1>Exploring Relative OCB</h1>
  <p>A new perspective on organizational citizenship behavior</p>
</section>

<div class="essay-container">
  <p>
    The study introduces the concept of <strong>Relative Organizational Citizenship Behavior (Relative OCB)</strong>, 
    a fresh lens for understanding workplace dynamics. It refers to how a follower’s supportive actions toward their supervisor compare to those of their peers—highlighting the importance of relative standing in organizational behavior.
  </p>

  <div class="highlight">
    “Relative OCB captures not only what employees do, but how their actions stack up against others in the same context.”
  </div>

  <h2>Key Findings</h2>
  <p>
    The study found that employees with higher Relative OCB are viewed more favorably by supervisors. However, this advantage is moderated by supervisors' competence uncertainty—meaning that when supervisors are unsure of their own abilities, they may respond with favoritism.
  </p>

  <h2>Practical Implications</h2>
  <div class="callout">
    📌 Supervisors should be aware of the unintended consequences of comparing employees on relative behaviors.  
    📌 Organizations should foster a culture of collaboration instead of competition to protect against favoritism.
  </div>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    By focusing on Relative OCB, this framework brings deeper insight into how employees are evaluated and how organizational dynamics unfold. It encourages managers to cultivate equity and awareness in recognition practices.
